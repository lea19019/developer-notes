# Basics of Object Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based on the concept of wrapping pieces of data, and behavior related to that
data, into special bundles called objects, which are constructed from a set of “blueprints”, defined by a programmer, called classes.

OOP is based on four pillars, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance.

- **Abstraction:** is a model of a real-world object or phenomenon, limited to a specific context, which represents all details relevant to this context with high accuracy and omits all the rest.

- **Encapsulation:** is the ability of an object to hide parts of its state and behaviors from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program.

- **Inheritance:** is the ability to build new classes on top of existing ones

- **Polymorphism:** is the ability of a program to detect the real class of an object and call its implementation even when its real type is unknown in the current context.
