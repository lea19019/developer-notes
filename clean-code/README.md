# Clean code

## What is clean code?

Clean code is code that's easy to understand and work with. Since us as developers spend a lot of time reading code, the code we write should help us understand quickly what is it that we are trying to achive with the code.

- [Names](./names.md)
- [Comments & Formatting](./comments-formatting-structure.md)
- [Functions](./functions-methods.md)
- [Control Structures & Errors](./control-structures.md)
- [Classes & Data Structures](./classes.md)

**REMEMBER!**

Clean code is code which is easy to read and understand BY HUMANS.

Clean code is about questionning the code you have and trying it to make it better, is not about checking rules.
