# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program.

If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong abstraction.
Break the hierarchy if it breaks the substitution test.
If you need to verify the type of class to apply something, modify it in such a way that you don't have to ask, just tell.
